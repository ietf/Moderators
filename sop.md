# Sergeant-at-Arms Standard Operating Procedures

## Escalation Path

For a specific incident:

1. Start with semi-private message between the individual and the SAA
2. If it continues, warning becomes public
3. If it still continues, consider 30-day PR ban

## Engagement

Be **explicit** and **specific** and **empathetic**

Before starting an engagement, inform and/or vet initial communications with the rest of SAA.

* **Explicit**
  * For the initial contact, why the SAA is reaching out
  * Set expectations for this engagement
    * State correspondence will be including/forwarding to [saa@ietf.org][SAA-ML]
    * State the desired outcomes from the engagement
    * State what the actions the SAA is (e.g., "request that you ... in furture messagts") and **is not** taking (e.g., "no PR restrictions")
    * State how the SAA will escalate from here
    * State that the [OMBUDSTEAM] is being consulted, if warranted
* **Specific**
  * What the content that triggered the engagement
  * Why that content is problematic/concerning
  * If determined to be the latest in chronic behavior, include references from [public archives][IETF-ARC] to present/establish the pattern
* **Empathic**
  * Remember "we are all human beings" -- the actor, the target, and possibly the subject
  * For a single incident, approach from the assumption of "good faith"
