# IETF Moderators 
#### *Formerly called Sergeants-at-Arms(SAA)*

This is a repository of guidelines, procedures, and templates used by the IETF Moderators team (formerly called Sergeants-at-Arms(SAA)). The goal of the Moderators team is to foster an environment of digntity, decency, and respect on ietf@ietf.org where everyone feels welcome to contribute.

This repository also contains [guideliness for the last-call@ietf.org mailing list](last-call.md).

While [RFC 9245] creates the role of Moderators for the ietf@ietf.org mailing list, the guidance for inappropriate postings and the actions to be taken are not well-defined.  This repository aims to address this lack of clarity.

* [Standard Operating Procedures](sop.md) outlines how and when the Moderators engages with inappropriate postings, including escalation paths.
* [Templates](email-templates) that engagement messages from the Moderators adhere to.
* [Last Call Templates](last-call-templates) that engagement messages from the Last Call team adhere to.
* A definition of [Uncivil Commentary](unprofessional-commentary.md) the Moderators follows.

This set of documents is considered a work-in-progress, and is expected to evolve to meet the needs of the IETF.
