# Last Call Standard Operating Proceedure

## Personnel

The Last Call team can be reached by emailing [last-call-owner@ietf.org](mailto:last-call-owner@ietf.org).

Current team members are:
* Bron Gondwana <[brong@fastmailteam.com](mailto:brong@fastmailteam.com)>
* Jared Mauch <[jared@puck.nether.net](mailto:jared@puck.nether.net)>

## General operations

The Last Call team strive to monitor all postings on last-call@ietf.org on a daily basis. The IETF Chair also monitors the list but may not be in a position to read each message or monitor every day.

The rules for engagement are similar to those of ietf@ietf.org; so everything from the code of conduct there also applies to this list, with stronger content restriction - the Last Call list is specifically for discussion of documents in last-call and other IESG activities.

## Escalation ladder for handling issues other than "off topic"

The Last Call team use the same process as the Moderators of the ietf@ietf.org mailing list as described in [their sop](sop.md).

## Handling of conversations drifting off topic

The vast majority of discussions on the last-call mailing list are related to drafts which are in IETF-wide last call and come from a specific area.  When these get too complex; the Last Call team may ask the responsible area director to guide the conversation back to the source working group, or ask those involved to take a pause and give the authors a chance to respond.

In general, participants are asked to address their feedback to the authors of documents or the escalation path (chairs, area directors, assigned reviewers, and the IETF chair).  If a conversation becomes heated between participants who are not one of those parties, the Last Call team may intervene and ask people to wait for author feedback before continuing the conversation.

### Posting Rights actions

A specific area that commonly causes significant traffic to the last-call list are BCP 83 posting rights actions.

If these get out of hand, the last-call team will remind contributors that the purpose of a Posting Rights last call is to inform the IESG, and to restrict their contributions to directly address the specific PR action, and to address their contributions to the IESG, not to other participants on the mailing list.

## Finding an appropriate forum

In many cases, the correct next location is the ietf@ietf.org list for conversations which have drifted out of last-call territory, however the Last Call team recommends that participants try to identify a more specific location.  It is acceptable for participants in a conversation that has already kicked-off on the last-call list to cross-post a single message advising the list of the location where the conversation has moved.
