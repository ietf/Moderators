Hi [NAME],

I am writing to you on behalf of the Team for last-call@ietf.org. This message has been vetted with others on the Last Call team, which is described in more detail at [1] and [2].

We are reaching out to you because of your recent message to last-call@ietf.org [3] under a new subject line but on the same topic against the direction from the IETF Chair [4]. 

Given our correspondence with you on [DATE], we believe you are engaging in a pattern of abuse that warrants a temporary restriction of your posting rights. Your posting rights will be restricted for the next 14 days and we will notify last-call@ietf.org of the restriction as per our SOP [5]. 

Thanks,
[NAME] on behalf of the Team for last-call@ietf.org
