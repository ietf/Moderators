Hi all,

We wanted to let the list know that the Team for last-call@ietf.org (described in more detail at [1]) has been in touch with [NAME] off-list concerning their recent message [2] to last-call@ietf.org under a new subject line but on the same topic against the direction from the IETF Chair [3]. We encourage everyone to review the IETF list charter [4] and our SOP [5]. 

Thanks,
[NAME] on behalf of the Team for last-call@ietf.org
