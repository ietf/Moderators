Hi all,

We wanted to let the list know that the Team for last-call@ietf.org (described in more detail at [1]) has been in touch with [NAME] off-list concerning their recent messages [2][3] with a request to take a voluntary cooling-off break. We encourage everyone to review the IETF list charter [4] and avoid postings that include uncivil commentary [5]. 

Thanks,
