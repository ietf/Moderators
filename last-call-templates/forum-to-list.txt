Hi all,

We wanted to let the list know that the Last Call team (described in more detail at [1]) consider this thread [2] to be more appropriate for this [LIST][3]. And as per the IETF list charter [4], we suggest that the last-calls should be moved to the more specific forum identified. 

[The Last Call team has been in touch with the [LIST] administers off-list.] (if required)

Thanks,
[NAME] on behalf of the Team for last-call@ietf.org
