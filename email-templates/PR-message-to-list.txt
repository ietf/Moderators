Hi all,

We wanted to let the list know that the sergeant-at-arms (SAA) team (described in more detail at [1]) has determined that [NAME] has engaged in a pattern of abuse based on their recent messages to this list [2][3]. Their posting rights to the ietf@ietf.org mailing list have been restricted for the next 14 days.  We encourage everyone to review the IETF discussion list charter [4] and avoid postings that include unprofessional commentary [5]. 

Thanks,
[NAME] on behalf of the SAA team
