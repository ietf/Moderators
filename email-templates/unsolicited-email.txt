Hi [NAME],

I am writing to you on behalf of the sergeant-at-arms (SAA) team for ietf@ietf.org. This message has been vetted with others on the SAA team, which is described in more detail at [1].

We are reaching out to you because of your recent message to ietf@ietf.org [2]. The message includes unsolicited email as per [3]. Please try to avoid sending these messages on ietf@ietf.org in the future. You can reach the IETF chair at chair@ietf.org to seek approval before sending. 

We consider this an initial suggestion. We do not believe your message is part of a pattern of abuse that would warrant the restriction of your posting rights. We will be notifying ietf@ietf.org that we have been in touch with you. If a pattern emerges, we will consider temporarily restricting your posting rights to ietf@ietf.org.

Thanks,
[NAME]
