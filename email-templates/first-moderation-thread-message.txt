[NAME],

I am writing to you on behalf of the Moderators team for ietf@ietf.org. This message has been vetted with others on the Moderators team, which is described in more detail at [1] and [2].

We are reaching out to you because of your recent message to ietf@ietf.org [3] under a new subject line but on the same topic against the direction from the IETF Chair [4]. 

We are concerned that this message is part of an emerging pattern of abuse, given our previous attempts to close the discussion on this topic for the time being. As such, we request that you take a voluntary 5-day break from posting to ietf@ietf.org as per our SOP [5]. We will be notifying ietf@ietf.org that we have been in touch with you. If we continue to see this pattern, we will temporarily restrict your posting rights to ietf@ietf.org for 14 days.

If you wish for us to make this message public, please let us know and we will re-send it with ietf@ietf.org on cc.

Thanks,
[NAME] on behalf of the Moderators team for ietf@ietf.org
